# Pandora Blank

This is a "[blank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planchet)" repository which can be used to create tools within the Pandora ecosystem. This has all of the defaults that we require for Pandora software including requirements management with poetry and documentation.

If you are starting a new Pandora tool from scratch, consider forking this repository and updating it to begin your tool.
